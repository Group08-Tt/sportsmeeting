With the development of society, the Internet era has arrived. In this era, nothing can stay the same. Bookkeeping has changed from paper offices to paperless offices, paper money payments have changed to mobile payments, and many sports events remain the same: personnel information is manually managed, athletes are notified via radio, and events and rankings are announced via paper or radio. The traditional model sometimes runs into problems like not being able to check in on site.
